# Responsive Tailwind Website  
Static Website Assignment – Tamwood Web Development

## Overview  
This project is a fully responsive static website developed as part of the Front-End assignment focused on practicing Tailwind CSS, responsive design techniques, animations, transitions, and semantic HTML structure.

The goal was to recreate a high-fidelity Figma mockup as closely as possible, ensuring pixel-accuracy on desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints while relying entirely on Tailwind CSS utilities.

This project was developed collaboratively by **Isabella Marcucci** and **Vojtech Kousal**.

## Project Requirements  

### Visual Accuracy  
- The website must look exactly like the provided design mockup.  
- Typography, spacing, imagery, and layout must match the Figma as closely as possible.

### Responsiveness  
- The layout must adapt seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.  
- Tailwind responsive utilities (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`) were used to adjust structure, font sizes, spacing, and alignment.

### Tailwind-Only Styling  
- All styling was implemented using Tailwind utility classes.  
- No external CSS files or inline CSS were used, except for:
  - Custom CSS variables  
  - Animation definitions  

### Animations and Transitions  
- At least three transitions were applied to interactive elements.  
- At least three custom animations were created and assigned to elements of the layout, enhancing movement and visual polish without deviating from the original design intent.

### CSS Variables  
- Global design tokens were defined using CSS variables, including:
  - Font families  
  - Text colors  
  - Theme colors  
  - Other shared style tokens  
- Variables were integrated into Tailwind using arbitrary value notation when necessary.

### Interaction  
- Hover and focus states were implemented using Tailwind variants to enrich the user interface and provide visual feedback to users.
